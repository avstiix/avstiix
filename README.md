## About Me  

Hi! I'm Luna, also known as Avstiix. I’m a web developer and computing enthusiast. I currently work at **Roblox Corporation**, and I also own a small company called **Radiance Dynamics**, which specializes in building **Discord bots** and custom **APIs**.  

I’m passionate about both frontend and backend web development, and I love diving into low-level computing projects like creating kernels, operating systems, and other advanced tech tools.
